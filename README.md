# Learning to Measure Changes: Fully Convolutional Siamese Metric Networks for Scene Change Detection

The key factor of scene change detection is to learn effective feature to have higher similarity for changed parts and lower similarity for unchanged parts. However, the state of the art  methods on change detection adopt full convolutional network based semantic segmentation method to distinguish changed and unchanged parts, which lacks in semantic discriminative in feature space and suffers from fake changes caused by noise. In this paper, we propose a novel Fully Convolutional siamese metric Network (CosimNet) and utilize various contrastive loss functions, including original contrastive loss and threshold contrastive loss to pull together similar pairs and push apart dissimilar pairs in the feature space. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach with experiments on three challenging datasets including CDnet, PCD2015, and VL-CMU. Our approach is highly robust to lots of challenging conditions, such as illumination change, small viewpoint difference, large viewpoint difference caused by camera rotation, and zooming. We also show the explanation of proposed method via the visualization of change map and disentangled feature space by t-SNE.
